# My own website: Caroldoscopio. 

## Created with Eleventy and in collaboration with @leouieda.

## Notes:

We≈ïe using a `Makefile` to create rules for generating, serving and cleaning the website.

* Generating the website: `make` or `make all`
* Serving the HTML to http://localhost:8080: `make serve`
* Cleaning the automatically generated files (the `_site` folder): `make clean`

The page content (the text) is created in Markdown file (`.md`) and converted to HTML by Eleventy. The site layout (the HTML around the content) is defined in "templates"defined in the `_includes` folder. The template language is called [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Eleventy will combine the content (Markdown) with the template (Liquid) to generate the HTML files in `_site`.

All of the text in the Markdown file is included in the `{{ content }}` variable in the template. Extra avriables ca be defined in the header of te Markdown file. These can then be acessed in the template using the same synthax (for example `{{ date }}` and `{{ title}}`).

**Sidenote:** Dates aee automatically formatted by Eleventy.
