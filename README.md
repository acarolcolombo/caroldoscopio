# My own website: Caroldoscopio. 

## Created with Eleventy and in collaboration with @leouieda.

## Notes:

We≈ïe using a `Makefile` to create rules for generating, serving and cleaning the website.

* Generating the website: `make` or `make all`
* Serving the HTML to http://localhost:8080: `make serve`
* Cleaning the automatically generated files (the `_site` folder): `make clean`
