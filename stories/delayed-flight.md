Marina was walking from one side to another in the airport terminal near Gate B30. They started calling for the premium passengers to board into the airplane whose destination was Recife. She used the loo one more time just to be sure. Although the trip was short, only about 3 hours from Rio de Janeiro, she couldn’t imagine herself balancing to pee in the air. At least she imagined that would be like when she uses the loo in the bus, everything shaking and even worse when the bus had to stop. A nightmare. Lucas held her sweating hands, stopping her for a few minutes. “You’ll love the experience! I’m here with you.” In a way, his words calm her down for a moment. She felt secure with him. She has never conceived she would realise her dream to go to the Northeastern beaches of Brazil to celebrate their first year together. Lucas had organised every detail of the trip, which left her without words. Life was finally giving her a break from her complicated and unlucky experiences.

The flight was even better than she expected, she wasn’t sick at all. She could picture herself dancing in the clouds. The city looked like a scale model, she loved the change of perspective.
As soon as they arrived, they rented a car to drive along the coastline. Marina wasn’t blinking, every second mattered. The song on the radio made the moment look like a film.
<br>
“'Cause there's a place we like to drive,
<br>
Way out in the country,
<br>
Five miles out of the city limit we're singing,
<br>
And your hand's upon my knee…”

They stopped in different cities and beaches, ate local food and bought crafts. She would pinch her arm every now and then during the day to be sure she wasn’t dreaming . After one week, she had a small bruise in her left arm. When she thought everything was perfect, she realised it wasn’t…yet. That night in a restaurant facing forward to the most stunning beach she has ever seen, she was asked “Will you marry me?” She jumped pulling her arms around Lucas, and without fighting against her tears, she gave him dozens of kisses.
While driving to the airport, they were talking about the wedding and the trip. When silence stopped by, she would keep living all the moments again and again in her head. She smiled.

The flight was delayed for an hour due to the airspace maintenance. She was happy to postpone her waking up.

“Marina Lemos and Lucas Silva, please proceed to our balcony at the entrance of gate 2C” was announced by the speakers. They looked at each other and shrugged. When they arrived at the balcony, the flight attendant asked for their IDs and tickets, she had to double check some information in the system. She seemed distressed when she hung up the phone. Marina wasn’t really paying much attention, when she noticed Lucas a bit pale. He was looking at the security officers that were approaching them from behind her. She held Lucas’ hands “what is going on?”

The officers asked them to go to a private room. Marina was still desperately trying to look for answers. She knew they had nothing to fear, however for some reason Lucas looked more distant and quieter than usual. Why? He whispered to her ear “I love you.” She felt the tension of her body going away, she was probably misjudging the situation. Certainly, something was happening, her head full of possible explanations.
Without further ado after entering the room, “You two are under arrest. The policemen are on their way.” one of the officers said. Marina was shaking, her eyes and mouth widely opened. “What? Why? What 's happening? Can someone explain it to us?” She turned to face Lucas and he looked sad but not so confused as she was. She didn’t know what to think anymore. Maybe it was a mistake. Lucas was always confident, he may have been trying to control his anxieties while waiting for answers.

When the policemen arrived there was tension in the room. Marina stood up “Could you please explain what on earth is happening?”
One of the policemen seemed surprised by her reaction. “I thought they had already told you about the cloned credit card and the identity fraud. I mean, you know what I’m talking about. How can you deny it? We have all the proofs here. The other Marina Lima Lemos contacted the airplane company a few hours ago when she noticed the deception.” Marina’s head was spinning and she almost fainted. She looked at her fiancé and her fairy tale was suddenly becoming a nightmare. The policeman noticed her genuine confusion and continued “Such a smart move, using a similar name to organise a scam like this. You almost got away from it.” Lucas finally said “Marina is innocent. I arranged everything for this trip. Please let her go.” Marina started sobbing “Lucas, what have you done?”
